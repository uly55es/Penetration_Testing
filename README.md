# Penetration Testing Repository

This is my repository devoted to all things regarding penetration testing. I hope it will become a comprehensive guide for myself and others as I study and build up my skillset. Each directory will have a subdirectories containing notes and commands. Please note any tools will have separate files in Markdown and Bash syntax. While Markdown is useful for notetaking, I use the Bash files for reference and Sublime's syntax highlighter.

## Scope
